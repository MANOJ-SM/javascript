in regualr prming only one piece of code is executed at a time 

js is single threaded synchronous language :

--> it executes one line of code at a time and one by one line 

console.log("hi");
console.log("hello");
comsole.log("bye");


---------------
asynchronous progming : Asynchronous programming is a programming that allows tasks to run concurrently without waiting for other tasks to complete 


setTimeout :
------------

setTimeout is the webAPi which allows to execute some pieceof code after some delay 

1000ms = 1 sec 

setTimeout( "() => {             " inside the doublee qts " whatever is there , it is call back function 
                                                    bcoz it is passed inside another( setTimeout) function 
}",1000);


ex:
------
console.log("manu");

setTimeout( () => {    
    console.log("hello world!");        
},1000);

console.log("manoj");
console.log("manoj");
console.log("manoj");
console.log("manoj");
console.log("manoj");
console.log("manoj");

output:
-------
manu
manoj
manoj
manoj
manoj
manoj
manoj
hello world!

---------------

what happened in the above cose is when it sees the callback function with some dely it dosent wait for that and excute it , it just skips it and runs rest of code and later come back to this call back function and execute this 
---------------------------------------------
Note :
js is synchronous or asynchronous language ?

js is synchronous language but in case of any use of callback , promises or event loops it will behave as asynchronous ;
