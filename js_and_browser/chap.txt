// 1st js engine - spider monkey used in mozilla firebox

// 2nd js engine - v8 used in google chrome

each browser has its own js engine 

js engine is program that takes  js code and executes it

v8 is most efficent and powerfull compiler as it usses -
- just in time compilation [ JIT compilation ]
which is basically both the benefits of intrepreter(fast) and compiler(optimization)


js engine 
----------

 js code
   |
 parsing   creates Absract syntax tree [AST]
   |
compilation  takes AST and  creates machine code
   |    
 execution executes machine code(byte code)

--------------------------------

bowser provide objects and functions to interact with dom and other browser api's

1.alert - used to display a message 
2.prompt - used to get input from user and we can store that input in a variable
3.confirm - to confirm the action ( like deltion )

alert("hello");

let fullName = prompt("enter ur name","manu");  // default name will be manu, which can be changeable also 
console.log(fullName);

const isconfirm = confirm("are u sure u want to delete");

if(isconfirm){
    console.log("deleted");
}else{
    console.log("not deleted");
}
