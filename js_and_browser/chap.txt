// 1st js engine - spider monkey used in mozilla firebox

// 2nd js engine - v8 used in google chrome

each browser has its own js engine 

js engine is program that takes  js code and executes it

v8 is most efficent and powerfull compiler as it usses -
- just in time compilation [ JIT compilation ]
which is basically both the benefits of intrepreter(fast) and compiler(optimization)


js engine 
----------

 js code
   |
 parsing   creates Absract syntax tree [AST]
   |
compilation  takes AST and  creates machine code
   |    
 execution executes machine code(byte code)

--------------------------------

1.document object  model (DOM): 

document is the obj provided by browser to us and using that object we can manupulate many html elements 

2.Browser Object Model (BOM) : 

it is a collection of additional objects apart from dpocument object that are available in browser environment.  used to interact with browser and its functionality.

--------

1.alert - used to display a message 

alert("hello");

------

2.prompt - used to get input from user and we can store that input in a variable

let fullName = prompt("enter ur name","manu"); 

 // default name will be manu, which can be changeable also 
console.log(fullName);


------

3.confirm - to confirm the action ( like deltion )

const fullName = prompt("enter ur name : ","jhon");

const isuser = confirm("is user want to display his name");

if(isuser){
    console.log(fullName);
}else{
    console.log("user dont want to display his name");
}


o/p > ok and cancel button will be displayed on the screen and if user click ok then it will return if condition result and if user click cancel then it will return else condition result .


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

local storage : to store some dat in the browser in key value pair format.

to set item : value pair in local storage we use setitem() method and

to get item : value pair we use getitem() method

to remove/ delete  item  : value pair we use removeitem() method

to clear entire localStorage : localStorage.clear();

example 
---------

// setItem()

localStorage.setItem("name","manu");

//  getItem() 

const value = localStorage.getItem("name");

console.log(value);

localStorage.setItem("rollNo","29");

//  removeItem() 

localStorage.removeItem("name");

-------------------

// lenght of localStorage 

console.log(localStorage.length);

// another way of getting item in localStorage via index no 

console.log(localStorage.key(0));

//  another way to remove/delete  item from localStorage

localStorage.hobby = "photography";
delete localStorage.hobby;
